It aims to provide additional widget to the original framework, while following the original coding and layout.

Currently in the works:

* Sheckboxes

* Radiobuttons


SEARCH FORM
* Searchform with "reset" button.
TABLES
* Layout (No additional)
 PAGING
* Basic layout of paging (No additional functionality yet)
 
##TODO:
TABLE
* Search for thead/tbody, make style if they exist, otherwise dont.
FORM
* File Input Replacement.
* Inline label for input?
* Radio/Checkbox DISABLED...
SEARCH FORM
* Button instead of submit, would add icon support
PAGING
